= sleepy_penguin - Ruby I/O events for Linux

sleepy_penguin provides access to newer, Linux-only system calls to wait
on events from traditionally non-I/O sources.  Bindings to the eventfd,
timerfd, and epoll interfaces are provided.

== Features

* Thread-safe blocking operations under both Ruby 1.8 and 1.9.

* Mostly working under Rubinius

* IO-like objects are backwards-compatible with IO.select.

* Epoll interface is fork-safe

* Unlike portable event frameworks, the Linux-only Epoll interface
  allows using edge-triggered I/O for possibly improved performance

== Install

If you're using a packaged Ruby distribution, make sure you have a C
compiler and the matching Ruby development libraries and headers.

If you use RubyGems:

    gem install sleepy_penguin

Otherwise grab the latest tarball from:

http://bogomips.org/sleepy_penguin/files/

Unpack it, and run "ruby setup.rb"

== Development

You can get the latest source via git from the following locations:

  git://git.bogomips.org/sleepy_penguin.git
  git://repo.or.cz/sleepy_penguin.git (mirror)

You may browse the code from the web and download the latest snapshot
tarballs here:

* http://git.bogomips.org/cgit/sleepy_penguin.git (cgit)
* http://repo.or.cz/w/sleepy_penguin.git (gitweb)

Inline patches (from "git format-patch") to the mailing list are
preferred because they allow code review and comments in the reply to
the patch.

We will adhere to mostly the same conventions for patch submissions as
git itself.  See the Documentation/SubmittingPatches document
distributed with git on on patch submission guidelines to follow.  Just
don't email the git mailing list or maintainer with sleepy_penguin patches.

== Contact

All feedback (bug reports, user/development discussion, patches, pull
requests) go to the mailing list: mailto:sleepy.penguin@librelist.com
